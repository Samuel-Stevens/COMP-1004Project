            <h1 class="Main_Text">Strength Checker</h1>
            <p>This tool can help you assess the strength of your passwords by checking your password against a set of criteria to help ensure that the password is strong.</p>
            <p>Microsoft recommends that passwords meet a set of requirements before being used, this is to ensure that the passwords are hard to guess or brute force.</p>
            <p> To ensure this is the case there is a commonly used set of requirements for passwords these are:</p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>The password should be at least 12 characters long.</li>
                <li>A mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.</li>
                <li>Shouldnt be able to be found in a dictionary or the name of anything, such as using a difficult to spell name to try fool people</li>
                <li>Should be different from other passwords you use, this is especially important for things such as bank accounts of other highly important accounts</li>
                <li>It should also be easy for you to remember but would prove difficult for others to guess, making it memorable ensures that you dont need to constantly reset the password.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>To check if your password meets the basic strength requirements for most websites, you can check them here with our password strength checker.</p>
            <p>This tool is completely safe to use as it doesnt store any data that is input.</p>

            <h1>Password Generator</h1>
            <p>This tool can help you generate new passwords for sites by using a generator to make a password that is hard for people to crack due to the password being randomly generated, it removes the human element that makes passwords more guessable.</p>
            <p>Having a wide range of passwords and changing them often is a good habit to have to help reduce the threat any data breach can cause you with unauthorized access to your passwords.</p>
            <p>Using this password generator will generate a password that will be able to match the requirements that the strength checker looks for.</p>
            <p>These tools are also completely safe to use as the application doesnt store any of the data that is input or generated.</p>
